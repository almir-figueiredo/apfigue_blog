Initially, I should point out that the following text does not contain any lines of code, does not speak profoundly of any language, but is an important account for people who are considering devoting their time to learning languages ​​and web development tools.
<br/>
My programming experience begins in a very basic way, but that may be how many of the readers of this text began, trying to get the most out of Excell. Well, in November 2010 I was appointed to the public office I currently hold in the Federal District Government and started my activities in a run-over fauna monitoring project. Early on I noticed that the team had no up-to-date information on the data collected, as it took a few days to answer simple press questions like: How many animals died in the period and which species were most impacted. Checking this, I used Excell to create a small data update system as the animal list was updated. This was my first algorithm. For some years I was improving this system, even with many limitations, new analyzes were performed. In 2015 the project was closed with this rustic system managing to answer simple questions. 
<br/>
However, in 2015, I started my master's degree and the questions to be answered needed deeper analysis, so I got to know R and was introduced to the world of programming logic in a "real" way. Feeling that I could solve all the problems I was faced with only with new code alternatives made me in love with this world, but in July 2017, when I defended my dissertation, I moved away from this world a little, by new assignments at work, but I came across with a big public service problem, the bureaucracy. 
<br/>
I became a contract manager with veterinary clinics who enrolled with my agency to castrate dogs and cats in a population control program. However, to execute this project it was necessary to register animals and check if each surgery was actually performed so that payment could be made. Both activities, registration and control of the vouchers performed surgeries, are extremely time consuming and undermine the efficiency of population control. To try and solve this problem, again, with the help of Excell's knowledge, but a bit evolved with the use of Google Sheets, I created a web-based surgery scheduling and control system, so I could both register people as well as control the execution of surgeries remotely. Even so, there are limitations of the scheduling system, and it is still manual to define the dates of surgeries, for example. 
<br/>
Faced with some challenges to automate the registration and control of these surgeries I decided to start my web development studies to look for ways to make routine tasks increasingly automatic. And I decided to start my studies at Nodejs, ReactJs and React Native. In addition, I intend to study some artificial intelligence tools with Phyton to modernize the public environmental management actions of the Federal District. In the next posts I will tell you more about what I am studying and giving some information to help those who want to start this web development life.
